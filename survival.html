                Survival techniques are plentiful, but there are five basic
                survival skills that everyone who ventures into the outdoors
                should understand, and be fully aware of their potential need
                and use. This is just a brief outline, not a full explanation of
                all the requirements and items required in each category. One of
                the most important elements of survival is between your ears –
                your brain. Of all survival techniques, the most important is DO
                NOT PANIC, use your wits and practice all elements of the five
                basic survival skills before you may need to rely on them.

                <h5>Basic Survival Skill 1: Fire</h5>
                Fire is the king of survival
                techniques! Fire can purify water, cook food, signal rescuers,
                provide warmth, light, and comfort. It can also help keep
                predators at a distance and can be a most welcome friend and
                companion. As a survival technique, it is one that is essential.
                Each and every person who ventures into the outdoors should have
                a minimum of two ways to start a fire with them – one on their
                person at all times, and the other with their gear. A few small
                fires provide more heat than one large fire. Collect firewood
                you think you will need for the night and then collect the same
                amount again, experience shows you will need it. Conserve fuel
                by making a “star fire”; where the ends of large logs meet in
                the fire only, push inward as more fuel is needed. Make a
                reflector from your space blanket on the back wall of a shelter
                to reflect the heat from your survival fire to your back, sit
                between the fire and the back of your shelter wall.

                <h5>Basic Survival Skill 2: Shelter</h5>
                Shelter is the survival technique by which you protect your
                body from excess exposure from the sun, cold, wind, rain, or
                snow. Anything that takes away or adds to your overall body
                temperature can be your enemy. Clothing is the first line of
                shelter protection, have the right clothes for the right
                environment. Always have a hat. Do whatever you can to keep the
                layer closest to your body dry. Layers trap air and are warmer
                than wearing one thick garment. Do not expend energy making a
                shelter if nature provides one. Practice building a quick
                lean-to shelter in case you can not find your campsite, do not
                wait until you need to make one. Use a space blanket to prevent
                dampness, to insulate your shelter, or to wrap yourself up in a
                sitting or squatting position to concentrate your body core
                heat.</span

              <span class="mb-4">
                <h5>Basic Survival Skill 3: Signaling</h5>
                Signaling is unique among survival techniques in that it gives
                you the means and ability to alert any and all potential
                rescuers that you are in need of help. Fire, flashing light,
                bright color markers, flags, mirrors, whistles can all help you
                be found. Three fires in a triangular form are a recognized
                distress signal. Carefully bank your signal fires to prevent the
                igniting of your surrounding area. Use regular signal mirrors
                only when you can see a plane, or people in the distance. Use an
                emergency strobe light at night to help attract attention from
                those that may be in the area. Make smoky fire with organic
                material over the fire during the day to attract attention. Lay
                out ground messages to air signal in an open field, S.O.S. from
                rocks, logs, or colored clothing, whatever will be seen against
                the background. Most search and rescue parties use aircraft as a
                primary method of sighting.</span

                <h5>Basic Survival Skill 4: Food & Water</h5>
                Food and water are vital
                to your survival. Ration your sweat, not your water intake. You
                can live up to three days without water. DO NOT eat plants you
                do not know. Never drink urine. Always assume that you will need
                extra food and water when you plan your trip. Pack energy bars
                and candy in your pockets at all times, just in case. If
                possible boil all water 10 minutes plus one minute for every
                1000 feet above sea level. Strain water through your
                handkerchief to remove large particles. Try to drink only in the
                cool of the evening. Never wait until you are without water to
                collect it. Have some poly zip bags to collect and store water.
                Never eat any wild berries that you cannot identify. You can
                catch rainwater in your space blanket by laying it out in a
                trench.</span

                <h5>Basic Survival Skill 5: First Aid</h5>
                First aid as a survival
                technique is not just the basic medical needs, it is the primary
                way in which you act to survive. DO NOT PANIC, remain calm, and
                do what you have to do to take care of yourself. STOP means Sit,
                Think, Observe, and Plan. It is the most intelligent thing you
                can do when you realize you are lost or stranded. The most
                important element is to keep your brain functioning rationally,
                this is basic first aid for survival. Analyze your needs before
                every trip, create a medical checklist, and carry a small
                personal kit with you at all times. Most survival situations
                require only dressing for small cuts, bruises, and personal
                medication needs, make sure you know what you have with you and
                how to use it. Do not overpack, pack what you feel you will need
                to carry with you at all times. Prevent hypothermia by
                insulating yourself in a space blanket. Concentrate on being
                found, pack a picture of your family in with your gear to remind
                you of the reasons to remain calm, and to survive.</span
